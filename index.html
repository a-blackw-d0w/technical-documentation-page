          JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
          is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
          example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
          its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
          Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators,
          control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
          for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects;
          for example:
        </p>
        <br />
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="JavaScript">
        <header>JavaScript</header>
        <p>
          JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
          different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
          does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
          JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and
          basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed
          from LiveScript to JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
          declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
          number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
          JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more
          common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides
          dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for
          individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any
          special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of
          objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
        </p>

          >function helloWorld() { alert( "hello world"); } helloWorld();

        <p>
          Variable means anything that can be changed anytime. A JavaScript
          variable is the name of storage location. Variables can be used to
          store goodies, visitors, and other data. Every programming language
          use variables. We use variables as symbolic names for values in an
          application.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can create variables using any of these keywords: ‘var’, ‘let’ and
          ‘const’. Don’t worry if many of these words are new to you. You will
          understand these terms later.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can also declare two variables and copy data from one into the
          other.
        </p>
        <code> let hello = 'Hello world!'; let message;</code><br />

        <code>
          >// copy 'Hello world' from hello into message message = hello; // now
          two variables hold the same data alert(hello); // Hello world!
          alert(message); // Hello world!</code
        ><br /><br />
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Scope">
        <header>Scope</header>
        <p>
          When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
          global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
          current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is
          called a local variable, because it is available only within that
          function.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope;
          rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function
          (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the
          following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or
          global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in
          this case is an if statement.
        </p>
        <code>
          { // do some job with local variables that should not be seen outside
          let message = "Hello"; // only visible in this block alert(message);
          // Hello } alert(message); // Error: message is not defined </code
        ><br /><br />
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Functions">
        <header>Functions</header>
        <p>
          Quite often we need to perform a similar action in many places of the
          script.
        </p>
        <p>
          Functions are the main “building blocks” of the program. They allow
          the code to be called many times without repetition.
        </p>
        <code
          >Local variables<br />
          function showMessage() { let message = "Hello, I'm JavaScript!"; //
          local variable alert( message ); } showMessage(); // Hello, I'm
          JavaScript! alert( message ); // <-- Error! The variable is local to
          the function</code
        ><br /><br />
        <code
          >Outer variables<br />
          let userName = 'John'; function showMessage() { let message = 'Hello,
          ' + userName; alert(message); } showMessage(); // Hello, John</code
